Once you have the files on your computer, you can then open the Jupyter Notebook file locally and start working with it. Let's go through the process together.\n",

In this lesson, you practiced forking and cloning a repository, you learned how to open a Jupyter Notebook file from the terminal, and how to save your changes to disk, add them to Git, and upload them to GitHub so you have a backup of your work in case your laptop dies or you need to access it from another computer.\n"
